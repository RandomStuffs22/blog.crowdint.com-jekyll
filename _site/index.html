    <p>Rails is strongly based in the MVC concept, that means each part of
this framework is built to work smoothly under this concept.
Conceptually, we understand what we have to deliver in each case.
With dumb Views, lean RESTful Controllers and FAT Models(?) we can build
whatever we want, or more precisely, whatever we need.</p>

<p>Views and Controllers rely on the Model to deliver the business logic. Our Models,
empty at the beginning, slowly becomes into big monsters sometimes difficult to
maintain, scale, and usually, forget.
So with all that code, our <em>Models become FAT, and therefore we have to put
them on a diet sometimes</em>.</p>

<p>A common practice in order to get our models as Lean as possible is <em>extracting from
them all the duplicated code into modules</em>.
This way we can make modules that contains our common methods, scopes, method calls, etc.</p>

<p>For example, we have a Model named Product as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Product</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>

  <span class="c1"># Some shared behavior code.</span>

  <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="ss">:active</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:state</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;active&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="n">state_machine</span> <span class="ss">:state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:initial</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="ss">:active</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:active</span>
    <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:disabled</span>
    <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:deleted</span>

    <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:activate</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:active</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:disable</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:disabled</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:soft_delete</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:deleted</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">activate_all</span>
    <span class="c1"># This method Activates all the products.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">disable_all</span>
    <span class="c1"># This method Disables all the products.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">destroy</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">soft_delete</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
  
  <span class="c1"># Below this point there is some code for the Product specific behavior...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Let's assume we have Type and Category models that shares the Product shared behavior.
So we have duplication along the three models.
<strong>One of RoR rules is DRY and therefore we could send the duplicate code into modules</strong>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Product</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">CommonClassMethods</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">CommonInstanceMethods</span>

  <span class="c1"># Shared behavior code.</span>

  <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="ss">:active</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:state</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;active&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="n">state_machine</span> <span class="ss">:state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:initial</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="ss">:active</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:active</span>
    <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:disabled</span>
    <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:deleted</span>

    <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:activate</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:active</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:disable</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:disabled</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:soft_delete</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:deleted</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="c1"># Below this point there is some code for the Product specific behavior...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">CommonClassMethods</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">activate_all</span>
    <span class="c1"># This method Activates all the products.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">disable_all</span>
    <span class="c1"># This method Disables all the products.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">CommonInstanceMethods</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">destroy</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">soft_delete</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This way we can reuse all the class methods extending the CommonClassMethods
module and the instance methods including the CommonInstanceMethods module in our
models.
Anyway, we still have the state machine and the active scope duplicated.
What could we do to avoid duplication in that case? Well, Rails provides us a
great tool trough the <em>ActiveSupport::Concern</em>.</p>

<p>The ActiveSupport::Concern has a method named <strong>included</strong> where we can include all
the common behavior like scopes, validations or method calls.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Product</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">CommonBehavior</span>

  <span class="c1"># Below this point there is some code for the Product specific behavior...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">method</span> <span class="no">CommonBehavior</span>
  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">ActiveSupport</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Concern</span>

  <span class="n">included</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="ss">:active</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:state</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;active&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="n">state_machine</span> <span class="ss">:state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:initial</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="ss">:active</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:active</span>
      <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:disabled</span>
      <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:deleted</span>

      <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:activate</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:active</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>

      <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:disable</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:disabled</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>

      <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:soft_delete</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:deleted</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
  
  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">ClassMethods</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">activate_all</span>
      <span class="c1"># This method Activates all the elements.</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">disable_all</span>
      <span class="c1"># This method Disables all the elements.</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">InstanceMethods</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">destroy</span>
      <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">soft_delete</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>By extending the ActiveSupport::Concern we can include our states and active scope
in the CommonBehavior module, and reuse them.
Also, we include the instance methods and extend the class methods just including the CommonBehavior
module into our Product model. Those methods also looks more readable by putting
them into modules named ClassMethods and InstanceMethods.</p>

<p><em>Great! Now our models looks more Lean</em>.</p>

<p><em>WARNING!</em>: We have to be careful when using modules. Remember to initialize them to
make them available for your classes in <em>development</em> mode, this is because the
development environment loads the classes in a lazy mode!.</p>

<p>You can use something like this in your <strong>"~development.rb"</strong> to pre-load this modules:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Dir</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;lib&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;*.rb&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

    <p>We have been seeing a lot of posts about different Rails and Ruby topics,
such as  benchmarks, ways to develop ,implementations and more. But if you
are a n00b in the ruby world or if you are thinking in change to ruby, but you
are not sure about it, I will try to give some answers for the most common
questions that I think you may have.
Like PHP vs Ruby? or thoose sorts of things...</p>

<h2>PHP, .net, flex or ruby??</h2>

<h3>PHP advantage</h3>

<p>Well PHP is one of the most common and widely used languages for
 coding dynamic webpages. You can write code inserted directly in HTML,
 it's secure, stable an open source.</p>

<p>I have to said that it is easy to use, I've started to write webpages
in PHP and it was easy to understand 'cause, when I began using it I knew C,
and PHP is C based.  It runs in almost all systems (UNIX, Windows and MAC OSX).<br/>
Beginning to use it is as simple as installing Apache and add the PHP module,
 then you’re set.</p>

<p>PHP has a wide community and a lot of useful libraries.
There are a lot of books to learn from, and also PHP.net is awesome.</p>

<h3>PHP disadvantages</h3>

<p>First of all, not everything in PHP is a piece of cake, when I was coding in it,
I got some issues when I tried doing some more "complex" things, like making a
file upload feature and things like that.</p>

<p>PHP is not a 100% Object oriented, it's trying to implement it in the newest version, but is not as good as others.
The error handling is very poor in PHP.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you will get messy code because of  the lack of good practices.</p>

<p>You have to take care of some security flaws on your own.</p>

<h3>.net framework advantages</h3>

<p>I really don’t like to talk about it, but, I have to say that it's easy and it has a
very complete documentation.  It's an event language, so it is easy for n00b developers.
C# is powerful, binding and a couple of more features.</p>

<h3>.net framework disadvantages</h3>

<p>With this framework you have to work in Windows and within this enviroment, you will get a
lot of issues trying to connect to other DB instead of to a SQL Server. And it is heavy as hell!
Also, you have to pay for everything.</p>

<h3>Flex advantages</h3>

<p>I really don’t know much about it, so I ask to a friend of mine whom is nicknamed <em>Chicken</em>(Adrian Castillo). <br/>
He told me that Flex had a lot of positive points, like:
* Cross-browser.
* Multiplatform.
* Multimedia content.
* Authorship, you can create digital signs for you projects.
* And it is extensible.</p>

<h3>Flex disadvantages</h3>

<p>The bad things about Flex are:
when you create a project you have to choose a flash version, and you will
have to use that version only. If you want the edgy stuff, It will be not available
for everyone. There’s not to many docs and examples.</p>

<p>It's a event language, so if you are not careful, you will get a mess</p>

<h3>Ruby advantages</h3>

<p>Well, I am new in ruby too, I have like ~9 months using it, I think, and I have to say that
it has been amazing time. Everything is so easy, you dont have to worry in write
common methods, you have to worry about solving the problem that you have, not in trivial
stuff.</p>

<p>The guy who wrote it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto"><em>Yukihiro Matsumoto</em></a> wants to have simple code
not so complex, something with the developers feel free and happy.</p>

<p>It's also fast to learn, just take a look at the documentation and that’s all you have to do, besides practicing it.</p>

<p>In ruby everything is an object, an example.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">times</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hello world&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Take a look at the code and you will see that "10" is an object with the method "times", and it will show on the screen “hello world” 10 times, just like that. That's simple, huh?.</p>

<p>Another plus is that ruby has an excellent error handler.</p>

<p>The community is huge now, and you have a lot of gems and plugins to help in your projects.</p>

<p>When we are talking of ruby and PHP, we have to talk about <a href="http://rubyonrails.org"><em>Ruby on Rails</em></a> an
awesome framework for ruby, there are other out there(like sinatra), but
right now is the one I like the most.</p>

<p>So, What can I say about it?. Well you can create a web site in minutes...
I really meant that, with the <em>scaffold</em> function you will have a template
in a second(not recommended for important projects).
Theres a lot of cool functions, like time methods:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Time</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span>
 <span class="c1">#2010-12-19 23:55:57 -0600</span>
<span class="no">Time</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">day</span>
 <span class="c1">#2010-12-20 23:56:06 -0600</span>
<span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">day</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ago</span>
 <span class="c1">#Sat, 18 Dec 2010 05:57:15 UTC +00:00</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>It's a simple stuff but so usefull.</p>

<p>In ruby on rails, you will write a lot less code,
 easy configuration, it has an integrated testing framework.</p>

<p>And more and more and more.....</p>

<h3>Ruby disadvantages</h3>

<p>Like all the languages it has disadvantages, not everything is beatiful.
 Ok now a couple of them:</p>

<p>The documentation is mostly complete, but it doesn't have method examples or stuff
like PHP.net</p>

<p>If you don't have the money to pay the hosting it will be difficult to get your app
online, there's a solution <a href="http://www.heroku.com"><em>heroku</em></a>. Heroku is a free web  hosting company, but only free startups.
So I have to say that it's expensive to host apps.</p>

<p>Another thing is when ruby sites grow they will need a
robust infraestructure, it's heavy.</p>

<h2>My coworkers opinion</h2>

<p>I've asked to some of my co-workers about the things that they like about ruby,
and the things they don't. And I got the next anwsers about their likes:</p>

<p>They love the way you can change everything, like opening the methods and rewritting
them.
They said that everything is so easy to do, the sintax, write methods, the blocks,
etc.
Also, it's amazing how everything is an object, you can create methods for
that object, and access them so quickly.
It's really easy to learn.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I ask about the things that they don't like about it.</p>

<p>It's not multithread.multitask
It's so easy that sometimes it turns you into a lazy developer.
It's perfect. (I know i now I'm just telling you what they said).
It's heavier than PHP.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This are a couple of things, just to get an idea across. If you dig more I am sure,
that you will find more things, good and bad ones, and it's the same in every
language, you have to try it by yourself and see what can you do with ruby.</p>

<p>If you have another question or if you want to say that this post it's pure
crap, don't hesitate on telling. I am open to any kind of feedback.</p>

<p>I hope this help you a little bit to take a step into ruby or maybe to keep
outside of it.</p>

    <p>Earlier this month I decided to go to <a href="http://www.larubyconf.com">LA Ruby Conf 2011</a>.
I was already in San Francisco, and, since I was just an hour away via
plane, I jumped into one and attended the conference sessions on Saturday.</p>

<p>As expected, the organization and the conferences were awesome. Kudos to
the organizers.</p>

<p>Now, a small recap of what I learned there.</p>

<h2>ActiveSupport Three - It is finally getting interesting</h2>

<h3>Bryan Lyles</h3>

<p><a href="http://smartic.us/">Bryan Liles</a>, being the Greatest
Man Alive gave an awesome talk on ActiveSupport and its similarities
with <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/">Ruby Facets</a>.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have never used Facets, but it seems it's worth taking a
look.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/learn.html">API Documentation</a>, I've already
gone through it and I found a lot of interesting things going on there.</p>

<p>Sadly, Bryan was time constrained and he just gave a small part of what
seems to be a big, interesting talk about those two libraries.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of this talk for me was to learn that Rails 3
ships with a lot of built-in instrumentation, so, expect a lot of gems
to measure performance of the applications more acurately in the near
future.</p>

<p>Tried to google on the subject, and couldn't find a lot on
Instrumentations, so I went straight to the Rails source code.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/earFTF">Here you can get an example</a> more or less on how it works.</p>

<h2>NinjaScript: JavaScript so unobtrusive, you won't see it coming.</h2>

<h3>Evan Dorn</h3>

<p>These guys are making an awesome effort of separating the Javascript
dependency out of the HTML and the CSS.</p>

<p>So, they wrote <a href="https://github.com/LRDesign/NinjaScript">NinjaScript</a>.
From their github page:</p>

<p>NinjaScript is a jQuery library designed to allow unobstrusive scripting simply and easily.
Essentially, we use jQuery selectors to apply behavior the same way we use CSS stylesheets
to apply stylings.
Additionally, NinjaScript makes it easy to package up useful behaviors and apply
them quickly to disparate elements, or in different projects.</p>

<p>Looks promising, but there's still a lot of Javascript involved, and I
usually try to stay away from Javascript as much as I can, I am old
school.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, they also wrote the <a href="https://github.com/LRDesign/mizugumo">Mizugumo</a>
gem.</p>

<p>Mizugumo is a gem designed to provide Rails with JavaScript and AJAX behavior that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Absolutely seamless</li>
<li>Completely unombtrusive - no markup whatsoever in your HTML and</li>
<li>Gracefully-degrading: defaults to fully functional and sensible page-reload behavior when JavaScript is not available.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, that's more like it.</p>

<p>You can see it in action <a href="http://mizugumo-demo.lrdesign.com/products">right here</a>.
Try using that UI both with your JS enabled and disabled. See what
happens.</p>

<p>You're supposed to get all that sweetness just by dropping the gem and
doing some minimal configuration.</p>

<p>Haven't tried it myself, but probably will soon.</p>

<h2>The Rails Tutorial Story</h2>

<h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

<p>I have never heard about <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">The Rails Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Michael Hartl told us the story behind it, and how he ended up writing
all of that, and let me tell you something: it was <em>Inspiring</em>.</p>

<p>Talk about perseverance. I won't ruin this story for you, because,
obviously I can't tell it as good nor accurate as he did.</p>

<p>All I can tell you is, take a look at the site, do yourself some good,
buy the screencast / PDF bundle.</p>

<p>It does look like a very good way to learn Rails 3.</p>

<h2>How To Jam In Code</h2>

<h3>Ron Evans</h3>

<p>You probably know Ron Evans, he knows everyone. I had already seen this
talk when he gave it at <a href="http://www.magmarails.com">MagmaRails</a>.</p>

<p>Awesome. Period. Ron knows how to involve the crowd on his talks.</p>

<p>If you haven't seen this talk, you are out of luck since now he's more
into <a href="http://www.kidsruby.com/">Kids Ruby</a>. Can't wait to see that
talk later in the year, Bravo Ron! for thinking of the kids. Someone has
to.</p>

<h2>Working in Virtual Machines, the Vagrant Way</h2>

<h3>Mitchell Hashimoto</h3>

<p><a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is a tool for building and distributing
virtualized development environments.</p>

<p>I wonder if you can do some funky stuff with vagrant where you create
Windows virtual machines and run your cucumber features or Selenium
tests automagically on them.</p>

<p>I will have to play with this eventually.</p>

<h2>Securing Your Rails App</h2>

<h3>Jim Weirich, Matt Yoho</h3>

<p>Basics on Rails app security. I was sort of expecting something more
advanced from Jim Weirich, but, it was good.</p>

<p>Learned about the existence of these two papers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">Ruby on Rails Security Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.owasp.org/images/8/89/Rails_Security_2.pdf">OWASP Ruby on Rails Security Guide</a></li>
</ul>


<p>No Rails developer should be allowed to send code to production without
reading those.</p>

<p>Also learned that security holes can slip everywhere, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/snips/201102031214.html">even to the best
people out there</a>.</p>

<p>No one is safe on the interwebs.</p>

<p>By the way, if you've finally decided to be more serious about security, take
a look at <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/framework/">Metasploit</a>. A
framework to perform penetration testing on your Network.</p>

<h2>Twitter Mobile</h2>

<h3>Ben Sandofsky</h3>

<p>This talk was full of interesting stuff and could easily be it's own
post by itself.</p>

<p>Ben described how they work at twitter. I'll highlight what I think was the most
interesting parts of the talk.</p>

<ul>
<li>The record of tweets per second was set last New Years eve at 6,939
tps.</li>
<li>Twitter is heavily Service oriented. They didn't start that way, but
they have been transitioning in the last few years. Doesn't sound like
an easy task.</li>
<li>They created a DSL that allows them to create new Service endpoints
with just a few lines of code. Clever.</li>
<li>They use YAJL for JSON. Twice the performance just by dropping a gem.</li>
<li>They use GD2 for image processing since it's way faster than Image
Magick.</li>
<li>They use <a href="https://github.com/dbalatero/typhoeus">Typhoeus</a> for
parallel HTTP requests betwen their services.</li>
<li>They work in small agile teams</li>
<li>Usually composed of 1 PM, 1 Designer, 3 Devs</li>
<li>Iterative development</li>
<li>They believe in continuous shipping. They usually do 3 deploys a
day. The record? 7 in one day.</li>
<li>They have a rigorous test suite in place. It runs for 1 hour by
itself but they built an awesome fleet of servers that can run it in
<em>2 minutes</em>.</li>
<li>Sadly, no details on how they do that :(</li>
<li>They do beleive in Pair programming, but it's up to the teams to do
actually do it.</li>
<li>They do require code review before pushing something.</li>
<li>They deliver the features to small amounts of users before full
release.</li>
<li>They have no QA team. Every team is responsible of their features and
their code. They believe that developers tend to become lazy and
careless when there's a QA team in place.</li>
<li>Company culture is key to success.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I missed a review on some of the conferences, but I just included on
this post what I personally found as the most interesting part of the event.</p>

<p>LARubyconf just made me reassure my thoughts about small regional
conferences being way better than the big ones, being single tracked and
with a lot better content.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Ron Evans of <a href="http://hybridgroup.com/">The Hybrid Group</a>
for inviting us to have delicious brunch the next day at his place. Good
times.</p>

<p>Looking forward to my next conference. Don't know where or when yet,
<a href="http://www.rubynation.org//">Ruby Nation</a>'s lineup looks very promising.</p>

<p>Until the next time.</p>
