Last week, a good part of our team flew to Baltimore for Railsconf 2011. As
every year, it was a ton of fun, there was a lot to learn and it was inspiring.

I love going to conferences, not just because of the talks, but, because you
get to meet people. I like talking to the persons that wrote the gems that
I use everyday and thank them for their effort in creating awesome code so
we don't have to.

And not just gem writers, it's also fun to meet all those other Ruby
developers that enjoy using Rails and everything else as much as I do.

The best thing you can take out of the experience is inspiration.
Inspiration to follow the leaders. Inspiration to collaborate to open
source. Or, as Corey Haines said on his keynote, inspiration to be awesome.

Since we enjoy confences so much, last year we were bummed that there was not
a lot of Ruby conferences in Mexico so we organized
[Magma Rails](http://www.magmarails.com), and it ended
up being better than expected. this year we're organizing its second edition
and it's going to be twice as awesome as last year.

We're moving to Manzanillo Colima, since this year we are inviting people
from all over the world, it makes more sense to have it at a tourist friendly
city. You will be able to smell the ocean from your seat.

Right now we're looking for [speakers](http://www.magmarails.com/callforpapers)
and sponsors, contact us if you're interested. I promise it will be a lot of fun!
