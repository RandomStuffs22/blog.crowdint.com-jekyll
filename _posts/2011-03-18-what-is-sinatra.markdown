## So, you heard about Sinatra, and you're excited.
## but what is it? and what it's for?
## Just read the answers.

&nbsp;

## Sinatra is.
----
- *Is a Ruby web framework.* Use it to develop sites, web apps, services..
- *It's written in Ruby.* And we all love Ruby, isn't?
- *It's very simple, but yet powerful.* Like Frank, but ninja. 
- *It's a Domain Specific Language (DSL).* Say no to Controllers, hi to Routes.
- *It's is RESTful*. So it's based in URLs, and HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete, info) 

### Advantages

- *It's simple*, you only have what you need.
- *No obscure magic involved*. You always knows where you are, what you got, how and why.
- *Better performance than Rails*, and without drama.
- *Gems still talks to you*. You can use your favorite gems. 
- *Talks templates*. The views, supports all of them.
- *No big-fat app*, Your app can be stored in just one file!

### Disadvantages

- *No Rails mystical magic*, forget it.
- *You have only your needs*, sometimes that means everything from scratch.
- *Isn't MVC framework*, No controller/action based.
- *Not so popular than Rails*, remember, there is life beyond Rails.
- *No builtin helpers*, but you can use them, including filters, configs..

## Good for? 
----
API implementations, quick demos, minimal applications, widgets, mobile sites implementations, RESTul systems, service-based applications. 
You're  looking for *something more like Rails?*, check this out: [The Padrino project](http://www.padrinorb.com/).

And, that's pretty much Sinatra. Now, you should start with [Omar's][1] example, or read the [README](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) section on Sinatra's website, you should get your app running after 1 minute.
