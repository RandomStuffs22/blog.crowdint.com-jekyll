In our [last post we talk about Sinatra framework][1]; and Omar showed us how to build our
first test-driven Sinatra app.
Today, we're going to talk about what is behind Sinatra, the pros and cons, without any coding.

So, you've heard about Sinatra, and you're excited.
but what is it? and what it's for?
Just read the answers.

## Sinatra is.
----
- *A Ruby web framework.* Use it to develop sites, web apps, services..
- *Written in Ruby.* And we all love Ruby, isn't?
- *Very simple, but yet powerful.* Like Frank, but ninja. 
- *A Domain Specific Language (DSL).* Say no to Controllers, hi to Routes.
- *RESTful*. So it's based in URLs, and HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete, info) 

### Advantages

- *It's simple*, you only get what you need.
- *No obscure magic involved*. You always knows where you are, what you got, how and why.
- *Better performance than Rails*, less drama.
- *Gems still talks to you*. You can use your favorite gems. 
- *Talks templates*. The views, supports all of them.
- *No big-fat app*, Your app can be stored in just one file!

### Disadvantages

- *No Rails mystical magic*, forget it.
- *You only get the basics*, sometimes that means write from scratch.
- *Not a MVC framework*, No controller/action based.
- *Not as popular as Rails*, remember, there is life beyond Rails.
- *No builtin helpers*, but you can use them, including filters, configs.

## Good for? 
----
API implementations, quick demos, minimal applications, widgets, mobile sites implementations,
RESTul systems, service-based applications.
You're  looking for *something more like Rails?*, check
this out: [The Padrino project](http://www.padrinorb.com/).

And, that's pretty much Sinatra. Now, you should start with [Omar's][1] example, or read
the [README](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) section on Sinatra's website, you should
get your app running after 1 minute.
