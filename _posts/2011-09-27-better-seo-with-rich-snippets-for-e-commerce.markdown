While Rich Snippets started indexing by Google two years ago it’s still rarely
used on small and medium size websites. Big players on market such as Amazon,
Hotels.com, eBay are using it successfully and getting more benefits in SEO.
So, why don’t utilize it?

## What are Rich Snippets?
Rich Snippets allows search engines to collect more Meta information about
pages and its contents. The more information Google can collect about your
website the more relevant results users get, and thus you have better targeting on web.

## What you can do with Rich Snippets?
Today Rich Snippets allow describing entities of several types:

* Organizations
* People
* Products and offers
* Reviews
* Events
* Breadcrumbs
* Videos
* and Recipes

In eCommerce we’re mostly interested in describing organizations, products,
reviews and breadcrumbs. Other types we use in particular cases.

## Describe online store
In practice it makes sense to implement it on About or Contact page.
With Rich Snippets for Organizations you can specify following Meta info:

* Name of your business
* Link to organization home page
* Location of the business
* Telephone numbers
* Geographical coordinates of its location

With this structured information Google understands your website more accurately.
Additionally you might get benefits in local search as Google adds your business
to Google Places service.

## Describe your products
Benefits of implementing Rich Snippets to describe products are evident. Take a
look at picture below:

The website on top [www.pandoramoa.com](www.pandoramoa.com) describes products
in proper format. Because of that Google knows and provides not only relevant page
to users search query, but also shows relevant image and list of similar products
with links to them. Such huge snippet in SERPs grabs more attention and makes
it more likely to click on it.
It supports following Meta info:

* The name of the product
* Product image
* Product description
* Brand of the product
* Product review
* Product ID (sku, asin, upc, isbn or mpn)

## Format customer reviews
Customer reviews is a common tool in eCommerce which is used almost on every
online store. Once you give it a proper shape according Rich Snippets requirements
you get additional weight on search results. See how stars grab attention..

To enable Rich Snippet reviews on your page you need to specify following attributes:
* Item being reviewed
* Numerical quality rating for the item
* The author of the review
* The date that the item was reviewed
* Review body
* Short summary of the review

##Beautify breadcrumbs
Instead of displaying long URL in SERPs (which often looks ugly and gives no
real value to user) Google can show breadcrumbs if you create right markup for it.

Notice that each item in breadcrumbs is a link to specific page on your website.
So, in practice you replace long, non-valuable and not clickable URL with
structured chain of clickable links to your website.

To format breadcrumbs in this way you just need to specify following
attributes for each item:

* The title of a breadcrumb
* The URL of a breadcrumb
* The next breadcrumb in the hierarchy

## How to markup Rich Snippets?
Google supports three formats:

* [Microdata (HTML5 specification)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML5\))
* [Microformats (simple conventions)](http://microformats.org/)
* [RDFa (a way to label content)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa)

## One step back
While you have all these opportunities to increase evidence and weight in SERPs
remember that Google doesn’t guarantee that it will be 100% used. In most cases
it’s using, however consider it as an opportunity of SEO improvement.
